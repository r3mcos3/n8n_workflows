# n8n Workflows

This directory contains example n8n workflow definitions. These JSON files can be imported directly into an n8n instance to set up pre-configured automation workflows.

## Workflows:

-   **`authentication-no-env.json`**:
    Description: This workflow likely demonstrates an authentication pattern without relying on environment variables, possibly using hardcoded values or a different method for credentials.

-   **`email-report-gmail.json`**:
    Description: This workflow probably automates the generation and sending of reports via email using Gmail. It could involve extracting data, formatting it, and then sending it as an email attachment or body.

-   **`time-tracking-sheets.json`**:
    Description: This workflow is expected to handle time tracking data, potentially integrating with spreadsheet applications (like Google Sheets) to log or process time entries.

## How to use:

1.  Open your n8n instance.
2.  Navigate to "Workflows".
3.  Click "New" or "Import from file".
4.  Select the desired JSON file from this directory and import it.
5.  Configure any necessary credentials or settings within the imported workflow.
